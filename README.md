# Code Anth

This is the repository for [Code Anth](http://code-anth.xyz), which hosts a research project run by Gui Heurich.

The project combines programming and anthropology. If coding is making software and anthropology is researching people, what could the intersection between them be? That is what we are trying to find out with Code Anth. Currently, the project is housed at University College London (UCL) and will remain there until 2023 - at least.

You are more than welcome to be a part of it.

A list of TODO's is provided below. Clone and contribute.

# Learning and research group

We currenlty run a reading group on things that intersect technical software material and cultural studies of programming. We meet every Thursday at 3pm GMT. The readings can be found on Code Anth. Please email g.heurich@ucl.ac.uk if you want to join.
